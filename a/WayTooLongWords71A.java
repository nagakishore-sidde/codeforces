/*
 * Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so
 * long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.
 * 
 * Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10
 * characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special
 * abbreviation.
 * 
 * This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last
 * letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the
 * first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't
 * contain any leading zeroes.
 * 
 * Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and
 * "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".
 * 
 * You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with
 * abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the
 * abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any
 * changes. Input
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n
 * lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and
 * possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters. Output
 * 
 * Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the
 * i-th word from the input data. Sample test(s) Input
